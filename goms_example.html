        <h2>GOMS</h2>

        <p>
          The GOMS model of Card, Moran and Newell is an acronym for Goals, Operators,
          Methods and Selection [56]. A GOMS description consists of these four elements:
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            These are the user’s goals, describing what the user wants to achieve.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p>
            These are the lowest level of analysis. They are the basic actions that
            the user must perform in order to use the system. They may affect the
            system (for example, press the ‘X’ key) or only the user’s mental state
            (for example, read the dialog box).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p>
            As we have already noted, there are typically several ways in which a goal
            can be split into subgoals. In GOMS these goal decompositions are referred
            to as methods.
          </p>

          <pre>
GOAL: ICONIZE-WINDOW
. [select GOAL: USE-CLOSE-METHOD
. . MOVE-MOUSE-TO-WINDOW-HEADER
. . POP-UP-MENU
. . CLICK-OVER-CLOSE-OPTION
GOAL: USE-L7-METHOD
. . PRESS-L7-KEY]
          </pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Selection</h3>
          <p>
            GOMS does not leave this as a random choice, but attempts to predict which
            methods will be used. This typically depends both on the particular user
            and on the state of the system and details about the goals.
          </p>

          <pre>
User Sam:
Rule 1: Use the CLOSE-METHOD unless another rule applies.
Rule 2: If the application is ‘blocks’ use the L7-METHOD
          </pre>

        <h2>Worked Exercise: GOMS Description of Photocopying a Journal Article</h2>

        <p>
          One possible GOMS description of the goal hierarchy for this task is given
          below. Answers will vary depending on assumptions about the photocopier
          used as the model for the exercise. In this example, we will assume that
          the article is to be copied one page at a time and that a cover over the
          imaging surface of the copier has to be in place before the actual copy
          can be made.
        </p>

        <pre>
GOAL: PHOTOCOPY-PAPER
. GOAL: LOCATE-ARTICLE
. GOAL: PHOTOCOPY-PAGE repeat until no more pages
. . GOAL: ORIENT-PAGE
. . . OPEN-COVER
. . . SELECT-PAGE
. . . POSITION-PAGE
. . . CLOSE-COVER
. . GOAL: PRESS-COPY-BUTTON
. . GOAL: VERIFY-COPY
. . . LOCATE-OUT-TRAY
. . . EXAMINE-COPY
. GOAL: COLLECT-COPY
. . LOCATE-OUT-TRAY
. . REMOVE-COPY (outer goal satisfied!)
. GOAL: RETRIEVE-JOURNAL
. . OPEN-COVER
. . REMOVE-JOURNAL
. . CLOSE-COVER
